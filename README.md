Turing School Portfolio - Personal Site 

When conceptualizing my `Personal Portfolio` a "minimalist" design style was something that I wished to adhere to. In addition to suffering from `Protanopia` which is a form of colorblindness, my preference for working with simple color schemes speak to my design aesthetic of simplicity. As time progresses in the program, I'm looking forward to implementing more elements of the teachings provided to this endeavor. After viewing personal portfolios created by various designers and developers, I anticipate being able to deliver a finished product that is truly unique, and indicative of the skills I've honed.
